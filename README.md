# Assemblage

In this project, I present you an interactive text-based artwork made in processing and hosted on web. The artwork revolves around understanding the role the songs play in women empowerment. In instance, where one may be silenced, it is the music that gives us a voice. It has a power to make us stronger - either through poetic lyrics , contagious rhythms or combination of both. As early as one could imagine, music has enabled people to connect to each other, to community and especially to themselves in a much better way than anticipated. For centuries, women have used music as a way to outlet their struggles in daily lives. With many strong and inspirational women spreading hope and courage through art, especially music, there are still many struggles that still remain unshaken. But feminism continue to thrive. Music therapy can be used as a tool for sparking women’s empowerment and helping individuals take hold of their past, present, and future.

There are so many great feminist songs by women artists that celebrate feminine brains, brawn, and beauty. Some extol the virtues of self-love, while others tackle complicated political questions related to the challenge of gender. Some are just bops about getting dressed.Oftentimes, we do not want to talk about what troubles us, which is why music therapy’s nonverbal elements are very successful. Music acts as an outlet for trauma and recovery, while at the same time regenerating self-worth in those who may have lost it along the way. In this project, though limited scope due to technical limitations (discussed later), I worked with the Top 5 Feminist songs as per Glamour rankings and created an abstract artwork on processing to try to understand if the songs, broken down to their core elements - words, are actually giving out the messages as intended or not. 

To achieve this, I first used BeautifulSoup to parse the web pages and extract the lyrics. After storing them as text, I further processed them to be able to use them for artwork. This involved removing all the html tags, whitespaces, punctuation,letters and conversion to lower case letters.This was achieved by the nltk and re python libraries. To further process the data, I tokenized all the lyrics. To have much cleaner data, I removed all the words with length shorter than three and also removed all the stop words. Stop words are the most common words that include articles and others like “the”, “all”, “a”, “on”, etc. To avoid the duplication of the data, I created a copy list for each song that had only one occurrence of each word. These lists were then transferred to Processing manually to allow less data dependency. The code for this whole scrapping and the pre-processing of the text can be found on this Colab link:
