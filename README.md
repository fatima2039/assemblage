# Assemblage

In this project, I present you an interactive text-based artwork made in processing and hosted on web. The artwork revolves around understanding the role the songs play in women empowerment. In instance, where one may be silenced, it is the music that gives us a voice. It has a power to make us stronger - either through poetic lyrics , contagious rhythms or combination of both. As early as one could imagine, music has enabled people to connect to each other, to community and especially to themselves in a much better way than anticipated. For centuries, women have used music as a way to outlet their struggles in daily lives. With many strong and inspirational women spreading hope and courage through art, especially music, there are still many struggles that still remain unshaken. But feminism continue to thrive. Music therapy can be used as a tool for sparking womenâ€™s empowerment and helping individuals take hold of their past, present, and future.
